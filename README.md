# Density Altitude Calculator

## Overview
This MATLAB project calculates the density altitude of an airport using real-time weather data retrieved via an API. The program considers temperature, pressure, humidity, and field elevation, providing an accurate result for aviation purposes.

## Features
- **API Integration**: Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap.
- **Comprehensive Calculations**: Accounts for multiple weather variables, including field elevation.
- **Simple Output**: Displays the calculated density altitude for ease of use.

## Usage
1. Run the script `Project1Problem2.m`.
2. Ensure you have an active internet connection for API data retrieval.
3. The program will output the calculated density altitude based on the retrieved data.

## Files
- **tempKtoC.m**: Function to convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius.
- **Project1Problem2.m**: Main script to calculate the density altitude.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2021b or later.
- API Key from OpenWeatherMap.
